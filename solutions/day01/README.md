### I had a pretty simply solution of checking from the start and end of the string and incrementing by 1 place each time until a digit or string was found. My answer was coming up a bit short each time, so I went with this method. It is a bit gross, but it works. By replacing each 'string' with 'string#string', you don't break any other numbers that might char a character; you treat the problem normally after.
